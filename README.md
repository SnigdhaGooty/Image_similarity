# Image_similarity

This project implements an Image Similarity Recognition System that compares two input images and determines how visually similar they are. The system uses deep-learning-based feature extraction and distance metrics to compute similarity scores with high accuracy. It preprocesses images, extracts meaningful features, and calculates their closeness using techniques such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

The model is designed to work with a wide range of images and is capable of identifying similarities even when the images differ in lighting, angles, or backgrounds. The system provides a fast, reliable way to measure how alike two images are—making it useful for tasks like content-based image retrieval, duplicate image detection, face comparison, and dataset cleaning.
